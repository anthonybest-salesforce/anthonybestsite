## Local development

```bash
npx serve src/
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Deploy

The Heroku app is configured to auto-deploy from GitHub on every push to `main`. Open a PR, merge to `main`, and Heroku ships it automatically — no GitHub Action is involved in the deploy itself.

```bash
git push origin main          # only if working directly on main (use a PR normally)
gh pr merge --merge --delete-branch   # standard merge-to-main flow
```

The `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` workflow runs a post-deploy smoke test after each push — it polls the live URL with a content-hash compare against the source file, and only runs the test suite once the deploy has actually landed. Heroku does not gate on the smoke test; it's purely diagnostic.

## DNS

Full DNS record backup (including Google Workspace MX, DKIM, SPF, DMARC, and Salesforce records) is in [`docs/dns-backup.md`](docs/dns-backup.md). **Do not delete any of those records** — they keep Google Workspace email working.
